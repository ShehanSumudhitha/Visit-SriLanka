    <h3>#1 Beaches in Bentota and Aluthgama</h3>
    <p>
    Being relatively close to Colombo (a 2-hour drive covering about 86 km) there are a number of larger and more
    established beach resorts in both Bentota and Aluthgama. The beaches are long and sandy, the sea mostly calm and great
    for all types of swimmers. This stretch of the ocean is not suitable for surfing. There are lots of water sports in Sri
    Lanka offered throughout this area, including boat safaris along the Bentota River and more high-octane activities such
    as tubing and jet skiing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once you cross the Bentota River you enter Bentota proper, which has some smaller boutique hotels in Sri Lanka,
    especially on the prime coastal strip. Alternatively, there are good value options on the inland side. This strip has
    fewer local restaurants or even tourist restaurants. However, it is only a short drive in to Aluthgama. Aluthgama town
    is quite lively, with lots of typical everyday shops which makes for an interesting wander. There are a few local rice
    and curry places.

        <h3>#2 Beaches in Ahungalla and Balapitiya</h3>
        <p>
        There is a long stretch of beach in Ahungalla. We focused on the beautiful boutique hotels in Balapitiya. Somewhat like
        Bentota, there are not many local restaurants as most travellers staying in this area spend the majority of their time
        at their hotel. However, Ambalangoda, a larger town is a short tuk tuk ride away. It has a few local restaurants and
        lots of other little typical everyday shops.
        
        Our favourite boutique hotels along this coastal stretch are The River House and Kumu Beach.

        <h3>#3 South Coast Beaches in Sri Lanka â€“ Unawatuna</h3>
        <p>
        The beach scene at Unawatuna in Sri Lanka is one of the most established in country. It is popular with backpackers
        which offers the advantage of lots of choice in terms of cafes, bars and restaurants, however with space at such a
        premium the accommodation tends to be cramped. Unawatuna is only a good choice if you want a beach scene rather than a
        great beach!
        
        If you want a little more than the beach scene, take a walk up the hills, down to the coastline through the Jungle
        Beach.

        <h3>#4 Weligama Beach Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>
        Offering good beginners surf breaks, a smattering of bars, a lively town centre as well a laid-back beach strip and a
        range of accommodation options, Weligama has rightly become a popular beach scene. The construction of a large Marriott
        Hotel right in the middle of the bay has not dented the towns appeal, with mainstream resort goers and backpackers
        coexisting quite happily! The long stretch of surf beach in Weligama has many surf schools and board hire places, making
        it ideal for beginnings who arenâ€™t on a surf holiday but want to have a go. If you are a beginner looking to up your
        skills there are quite a few accommodations offering intensive courses (often coupled with yoga). Weligama is a good
        choice if you want a beach scene with a greater concentration of bars and restaurants. Cape Weligama is a lovely
        property to stay if you are in the mood to splurge.

        <h3>#5 Trincomalee</h3>
        <p>
            The beach scene at Unawatuna in Sri Lanka is one of the most established in country. It is popular with
            backpackers
            which offers the advantage of lots of choice in terms of cafes, bars and restaurants, however with space at such
            a
            premium the accommodation tends to be cramped. Unawatuna is only a good choice if you want a beach scene rather
            than a
            great beach!
    
            If you want a little more than the beach scene, take a walk up the hills, down to the coastline through the
            Jungle
            Beach.
