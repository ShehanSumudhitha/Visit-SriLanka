            <h3>#1 Visit the Temple of the Tooth</h3>
            <p>
                An obvious choice that heads the list. The UNESCO World Heritage listed Temple of the Tooth is an all-important and
                highly revered place of worship for local Buddhists. It also attracts devotees from around the globe that come to pay
                homage at this sacred site.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Temple houses the sacred tooth of Lord Buddha that is open to public and tourists during the â€˜Poojaâ€™ â€“ the religious
                ceremony. These ceremonies are held daily in the mornings and evenings â€“ three times a day. (5.45 a.m. â€“ 6.30 a.m. /
                9.30 a.m. â€“ 11.00 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. â€“ 8.00 p.m.). Itâ€™s great if you can visit the temple during these times to get a
                complete experience of the temple as it includes the ancient and traditional ceremonial rituals that are woven around
                ceremony itself.

            <h3>#2 Stroll around Kandy Lake</h3>
            <p>
                Can you take a walk around the lake in Kandy? Yes â€“ itâ€™s one of the city landmarks and an experience not to be missed.
                The Kandy Lake sits next to the Temple of the Tooth, so you can combine the two. As with most parts of this ancient
                city, the lake has its own history dating back to 1807 where Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, the last king of Sri Lanka,
                constructed the lake. The pavilion in the middle of the lake is said to have been the bathing place for the Kingâ€™s
                harem.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is a beautiful stroll around the lake taking approximately 40 minutes to an hour depending how slow or fast you walk.
            Early mornings and late evenings are good times to walk and enjoy bird life and the cooling breeze. Daytime can be quite
            hectic due to traffic that passes by.
            </p>

            <h3>#3 The Kandy Market</h3>
            <p>
                A wonderful place to witness local market activities in the city of Kandy! Morning hours are the best to take in all the
                hustle and the bustle of this busy local market in Sri Lanka. The market can be divided into three key areas â€“ the fish
                market, the vegetable and fruit market and stalls where anything from clothes, to handbags and ornaments are sold. There
                will be large wholesale shops that specialise in groceries including spices.

            <h3>#5 Royal Botanical Gardens Kandy</h3>
            <p>
                To the west of the city lies the Royal Botanical Gardens. The gardens are around 5 km from the main city of Kandy, or
                roughly a 15-to-20-minute drive in traffic. Itâ€™s a large tourist attraction with manicured gardens, a remarkable orchid
                collection and plenty of space to stroll and picnic. Itâ€™s very popular with locals during school vacations. Entrance
                fees apply!
