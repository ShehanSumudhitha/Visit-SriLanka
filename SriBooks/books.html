        <h1>Tamil Tigress by Niromi de Soyza</h1>
        <p>
        This is the autobiographical story of a former child soldier of the Sri Lankan guerrilla army Liberation Tigers of Tamil
        Eelam (LTTE). In 1987, at the age of 17, Niromi de Soyza found herself in an ambush as part of a small platoon of
        militant Tamil Tigers fighting government forces in the civil war that was to engulf Sri Lanka for decades. Leaving
        behind her middle-class family, the teenager had become part of the Tamil Tigers‚Äô first female contingent. Equipped with
        little more than a rifle and a cyanide capsule, her group managed to survive on their wits in the jungle, facing not
        only the perils of war but starvation, illness, and growing internal tensions among the militant Tigers.

        <h1>The Divided Island by Samanth Subramanian</h1>
        <p>
        This is a harrowing and humane investigation of the vivid and haunting story of Sri Lanka and its brutal thirty-year
        civil war. The author draws out the story of Sri Lanka today through travels and conversations; he examines how people
        reconcile themselves to violence, how religion and state conspire, how the powerful become cruel and how victory can be
        put to the task of reshaping memory and burying histories.

        <h1>Running in the Family by Michael Ondaatje</h1>
        <p>
        This is a fictionalized memoir; it deals with the author‚Äôs return to his native island of Sri Lanka in the late 1970s.
        This is an evocative record of his journey in which he simultaneously retraces the mythology of his Dutch-Ceylonese
        family, in particular the scandalous antics of his father Mervyn Ondaatje, his grandmother Lalla, and the luxurious
        frivolity of the 1920s. This is both an inspired travel narrative and family memoir by an exceptional writer.

        <p>
        This is a fascinating and absorbing travel narrative. Sri Lanka is a small island with a long, violent and enthralling

        Tamil and Muslim communities. As he walks in the steps of old conquerors, follows the secret paths of elephants and
        marches alongside pilgrims, he delves deep into the nation‚Äôs story, revealing a multifaceted portrait of the island
        today.
