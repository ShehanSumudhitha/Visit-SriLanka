                Jaffna is the main city of Jaffna peninsula in the northernmost district of Sri Lanka. Comfortable intercity busses from
                Colombo take 10-12 hours to reach the city of Jaffna.
                
                Sri Lanka Navy runs a passenger boat service off Jaffna peninsula to the Island of Nagadeepa where the ancient Nagadeepa
                Buddhist temple is located.
            </p>

            <p>
            Jaffna is the capital city of the Northern Province, Sri Lanka. 85% of the populations of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi
            districts are Hindus. The Hindus follow the Saivite tradition. The remainders are largely Roman Catholics or
            Protestants, some of whom are descendants of colonial settlers, known as Burghers. The Tamils are divided along caste
            lines, with the farmer-caste Vellalar forming the majority. Sea products, red onion, and tobacco are the main products
            in Jaffna.
            
            Jaffna is home to beautiful Hindu temples. An Old Dutch Fort still stands well preserved within which is an old Church.
            Another example of Dutch architecture is the King's House. No visit to Jaffna is complete without tasting the exquisite
            Jaffna mango, reputed for its sweetness. About 3 km away is the majestic Nallur Kandaswamy Temple, home to the largest
            religious festival in Jaffna. The Kayts Harbour is an ancient ship docking site in the Jaffna region.

            There arenâ€™t many culinary treats in Jaffna â€“ and (ironically) youâ€™ll get better South Indian food in Colombo. Places
            for a drink are also in short supply compared to most places in Sri Lanka â€“ the dining room of the Bastian Hotel and the
            garden of the Green Grass Hotel are two of the better places.
            </p>

            <p>
                The agricultural hinterland of Jaffna town â€“ and the source of much of its former prosperity â€“ is the Jaffna Peninsula,
                a fertile arc of land criss-crossed with a lattice of small country roads and lined with endless walled gardens and
                smallholdings in which the peninsulaâ€™s famed mangos are grown, along with a wide variety of other crops including
                chillies, onions, bananas, jackfruit and grapes. Physically and culturally the peninsula is virtually an island, almost
                completely detached from the rest of the country, and has always been far more densely populated than the more arid
                lands of the Vanni further south.
